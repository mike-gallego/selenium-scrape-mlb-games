What is the goal of this project?
    - I want to make a machine learning model that is designed to
        essentially predict which team is going to win the game

How will you collect the data?
    - I am going to create a python script that will navigate
        through https://www.espn.com/mlb/schedule/_/[DATE OF GAMES]
    - It will iterate through and collect the scores and that will be
        the outputs we want from the data
    - Each game has information that will essentially be our inputs
        for the model to train on
    - This is going be a work of web scraping to collect that data
        and store it into a type of data format (JSON, CSV, etc)

What kind of machine learning algorithm will you be using?
    - I will be using the basic Linear Regression Model because
        the inputs have a strong correlation on the output of the game

What are the steps for the project?
    1) Research methods of web scraping using python and see
        which method is the most efficient for our project
        - We will make a separate script to fetch all the data
            and store into a CSV file
        - Scrape each date start form March 20, 2019
        - Scrape each game in each date
        - Scrape each stat from those games
